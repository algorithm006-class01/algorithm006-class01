#
# Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
# 
# Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
# 
# Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its
# neighbors.
# 
# 
# class Node {
# ⁠   public int val;
# ⁠   public List<Node> neighbors;
# }
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Test case format:
# 
# For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index
# (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with
# val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an
# adjacency list.
# 
# Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite
# graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
# 
# The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return
# the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
# 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
# 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val =
# 3).
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: adjList = [[]]
# Output: [[]]
# Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists
# of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: adjList = []
# Output: []
# Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
# Output: [[2],[1]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= Node.val <= 100
# Node.val is unique for each node.
# Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
# There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
# The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given
# node.
# 
#
